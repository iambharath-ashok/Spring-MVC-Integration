#	Session vs Model Vs Request

-	By default model is request scope and values will available only for that particular requests
-	ModelMap will gets destroyed once request is completed
-	If we want some values to be persisted across the requests, then we should save it in Session
-	In spring mvc, we can save model values to Session Instance using @SessionAttribute annotation
-	Request Scope is available only to that particular request and will not be available for subsequent requests
	
		-	we should use @SessionAttribute("name") annotation with name of the attributes across all the controllers that can use the value 
		
-	Value will retrieved from model and will added to session scope so that will be available for all the subsequent requests
