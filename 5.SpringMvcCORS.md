# Same Origin Policy

-	The same-origin policy is an important concept in the web application security model
-	Under this policy, a web browser permits scripts contained in a first web page to access data in a second web page, but only if both web pages have the same origin
-	An origin is defined as a combination of URI scheme, host name, and port number
-	This policy prevents a malicious script on one page from obtaining access to sensitive data on another web page through that page's Document Object Model
-	This mechanism bears a particular significance for modern web applications that extensively depend on HTTP cookies to maintain authenticated user sessions
	-	as servers act based on the HTTP cookie information to reveal sensitive information
-	It is very important to remember that the same-origin policy applies only to scripts
-	This means that resources such as images, CSS, and dynamically-loaded scripts, can be accessed across origins via the corresponding HTML tags
-	Cross site request forgery attacks take advantage of the fact that the same origin policy does not apply to HTML tags




##	CORS - Cross Origin Resource Sharing

-	Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is standardized  technique for relaxing the same-origin policy
-	This standard extends HTTP with a new Origin request header and a new Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header
-	It allows servers to use a header to explicitly list origins that may request a file or to use a wildcard and allow a file to be requested by any site
-	Browsers such as Firefox 3.5, Safari 4 and Internet Explorer 10 use this header to allow the cross-origin HTTP requests with XMLHttpRequest
	- that would otherwise have been forbidden by the same-origin policy
	
	
##	CORS in Spring MVC

-	CORS (Cross-origin resource sharing) allows a webpage to request additional resources into browser from other domains e.g. fonts, CSS or static images from CDNs
-	CORS helps in serving web content from multiple domains into browsers who usually have the same-origin security policy.

-	Spring MVC provides @CrossOrigin annotation that can be used at both method level and class level
	


##	Spring CORS Allow All

-	@CrossOrigin allows all origins, all headers, and all the HTTP methods specified in the @RequestMapping annotation and a maxAge of 30 minutes
-	we can override default CORS settings by giving value to annotation attributes :


ATTRIBUTE	| DESCRIPTION
------------|----------------
origins	| List of allowed origins. It’s value is placed in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header of both the pre-flight response and the actual response.– * – means that all origins are allowed.– If undefined, all origins are allowed.
allowedHeaders	| List of request headers that can be used during the actual request. Value is used in preflight’s response header Access-Control-Allow-Headers. – * – means that all headers requested by the client are allowed.– If undefined, all requested headers are allowed.
methods	| List of supported HTTP request methods. If undefined, methods defined by RequestMapping annotation are used.
exposedHeaders	| List of response headers that the browser will allow the client to access. Value is set in actual response header Access-Control-Expose-Headers.– If undefined, an empty exposed header list is used.
allowCredentials	| It determine whether browser should include any cookies associated with the request. – false – cookies should not included. – "" (empty string) – means undefined. – true – pre-flight response will include the header Access-Control-Allow-Credentials with value set to true.– If undefined, credentials are allowed.
maxAge	| maximum age (in seconds) of the cache duration for pre-flight responses. Value is set in header Access-Control-Max-Age. – If undefined, max age is set to 1800 seconds (30 minutes).


##	@CrossOrigin at Class/Controller Level

		
			@CrossOrigin(origins = "*", allowedHeaders = "*")
			@Controller
			public class HomeController
			{
				@GetMapping(path="/")
				public String homeInit(Model model) {
					return "home";
				}
			}
			
			
##	@CrossOrigin at Method Level
		
			@Controller
			public class HomeController
			{
				@CrossOrigin(origins = "*", allowedHeaders = "*")
				@GetMapping(path="/")
				public String homeInit(Model model) {
					return "home";
				}
			}

	
	
##	@CrossOrigin Overridden at Method Level

-	homeInit() method will be accessible only from domain http://example.com
-	Rest all other methods in HomeController will be accessible from all domains

			
			@Controller
			@CrossOrigin(origins = "*", allowedHeaders = "*")
			public class HomeController
			{
				@CrossOrigin(origins = "http://example.com")
				@GetMapping(path="/")
				public String homeInit(Model model) {
					return "home";
				}
			}
	
	
	
##	Spring CORS – Global CORS configuration

-	In order to configure Cors globally we need to implement WebMvcCofigurer interface and register Cors mappings with cors register by overriding the addCorsMapping() method


		@Configuration
		@EnableWebMvc
		public class CorsCofiguration implements WebMvcCofigurer {
		
			@Override
			public void addCorsMapping(CorsRegistry registry) {
				registry.addMapping("/**").allowedMethods("GET", "POST");
			}
		}


##	 Spring Boot CORS with WebMvcConfigurer
In spring boot application, it is recommended to just declare a WebMvcConfigurer bean		


	
			@Configuration
			public class CorsConfig {
				
				@Bean
				public WebMvcConfigurer corsConfiguration() {
					
					return new WebMvcCofigurer() {
					
					
						public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {
							registry.addMapping("/**");
						}
					
					}
				
				}
			}
		
		
##	CORS with Spring Security

-	To enable CORS support through Spring security:
	-	configure CorsConfigurationSource bean and use HttpSecurity.cors() configuration by overriding WebSecurityConfigurer
	
			
				@Configuration
				@EnableWebSecurity
				public CorsConfiguration implements WebSecurityConfigurer {
					
					@Override
					public void configure(HttpSecurity security) {
						security.cors().disable();
					}
					
					@Bean
					public CorsCofigurationSource corsConfiguration() {
						
						CorsConfiguaration configuration = new CorsConfiguration();
						configuration.setAllowedOrigins(Arrays.asList(new String[]{}));
						configuration.setAllowedMethods(Arrays.asList(new String[]{}));
						configuration.setAllAllowedHeaders(Arrays.asList(new String[]{}));
						UrlBasedCorsConfigurationSource source = new UrlBasedCorsConfigurationSource();
						source.registerCorsConfiguration("/**",configuration);
						return source;
					} 
				
				
				}
