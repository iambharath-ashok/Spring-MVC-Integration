# Spring MVC Architecture


##	What is MVC Framework?

-	Model-view-controller (MVC) is a well known design pattern for designing UI based applications
-	It mainly decouples business logic from UIs by separating the roles of model, view, and controller in an application
-	Usually, models are responsible for encapsulating application data for views to present
- 	Views should only present this data, without including any business logic
- 	And controllers are responsible for receiving requests from users and invoking back-end services (manager or dao) for business logic processing
-	After processing, back-end services may return some data for views to present
-	 Controllers collect this data and prepare models for views to present.
-	The core idea of the MVC pattern is to separate business logic from UIs to allow them to change independently without affecting each other.

-	In a Spring MVC application, models usually consist of POJO objects that are processed by the service layer and persisted by the persistence layer
- 	Views are usually JSP templates written with Java Standard Tag Library (JSTL)
-	Controller part is played by dispatcher servlet

##	Dispatcher Servlet (Spring Controller)

-	In the simplest Spring MVC application, a controller is the only servlet you need to configure in a Java web deployment descriptor (i.e., the web.xml file)
-	A Spring MVC controllerâ€”often referred to as a Dispatcher Servlet implements front controller design pattern and every web request must go through it so that it can manage the entire request life cycle
