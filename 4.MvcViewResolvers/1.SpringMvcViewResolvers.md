#	Spring MVC View Resolvers

-	In Spring MVC based application, the last step of request processing is to return the logical view name
- 	Here DispatcherServlet has to delegate control to a view resolver so the information is rendered
- 	This view resolvers decides that which view should be rendered based on returned logical view name
-	These view resolvers are one or more view resolver beans declared in the web application context
- 	These beans have to implement the ViewResolver interface for DispatcherServlet to auto-detect them
- 	Spring MVC comes with several ViewResolver implementations

## Internal Resource View Resolver

-	InternalResourceViewResolver helps in mapping the logical view names to directly view files under a certain pre-configured directory
-	InternalResourceViewResolver Configuration:
	-	To register InternalResourceViewResolver:
			
			
			<bean class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.InternalResourceViewResolver">
				<property name="viewClass" value="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.JstlView" />
				<property name="prefix" value="/WEB-INF/jsp/" />
				<property name="suffix" value=".jsp" />
			</bean>
			
			
-	 Java Config:

			@Bean
			 public ViewResolver configureViewResolver() {
				 InternalResourceViewResolver viewResolve = new InternalResourceViewResolver();
				 viewResolve.setPrefix("/WEB-INF/jsp/");
				 viewResolve.setSuffix(".jsp");
			 
				 return viewResolve;
			 }
			 
			 
##	XmlViewResolver 

-	Contrary to InternalResourceViewResolver where each logical view name is mapped to physical location of view directly
-	XmlViewResolver, views are declared as Spring beans
			
				<bean class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.XmlViewResolver">
					<property name="location">
						<value>/WEB-INF/admin-views.xml</value>
					</property>
				</bean>
				
				<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
					xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
					xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
						http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd">
				 
					<bean id="home" class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.JstlView">
						<property name="url" value="/WEB-INF/jsp/home.jsp" />
					</bean>
				 
					<bean id="admin/home" class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.JstlView">
						<property name="url" value="/WEB-INF/jsp/admin/home.jsp" />
					</bean>
				 
					<bean id="logOffRedirect" class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.RedirectView">
						<property name="url" value="home" />
					</bean>
				</beans>


-	We can declare the view beans in the same configuration file as the web application context, but it’s better to isolate them in a separate configuration file.			 
-	The first two beans in above configuration are pretty obvious
-	Logical view name “home” is mapped to “/WEB-INF/jsp/home.jsp” and “admin/home” is mapped to “/WEB-INF/jsp/admin/home.jsp“
-	The third bean do not map any physical view file, rather it redirect the request to url “home” which is actually handled by controller of URL “/home“
- 	Whatever logical name that controller will return, that view will be looked up into bean mappings and then actual view file will be obtained




##	ResourceBundleViewResolver

-	ResourceBundleViewResolver loads view beans from a resource bundle in the classpath root
-	Note that ResourceBundleViewResolver can also take advantage of the resource bundle capability to load view beans from different resource bundles for different locales (this is not possible with other two view resolvers)
-	By default, ResourceBundleViewResolver loads view names from “views.properties” file present into classpath but this location can be overridden through the basename property





					<bean class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.ResourceBundleViewResolver">
						<property name="basename" value="views" />
					</bean>


-	In views.properties resource bundle, we can declare view beans in the format of properties and their declaration is equivalent to the XML bean declaration which we did in XmlViewResolver configuration


					home.(class)=org.springframework.web.servlet.view.JstlView
					home.url=/WEB-INF/jsp/home.jsp
					 
					 
					adminHome.(class)=org.springframework.web.servlet.view.JstlView
					adminHome.url=/WEB-INF/jsp/admin/home.jsp
					 
					logOffRedirect.(class)=org.springframework.web.servlet.view.RedirectView
					logOffRedirect.url=home

-	With above configuration, when controller return a logical view name “home” then ResourceBundleViewResolver will find the key starting with “home” in views.properties file, and return the corresponding view’s URL i.e. “/WEB-INF/jsp/home.jsp” back to the DispatcherServlet.
